# Astarte Flow

Astarte Flow lets you create reusable Blocks and Pipelines. This way, you can reuse the same pipeline in countless computation scenarios with different settings. And you can share your pipelines with others, too! Bundle your algorithm in a container and youâ€™re ready to go.

## Resources and Quickstart

 * [Astarte Flow Documentation](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/flow/snapshot) - The main resource to learn about Astarte Flow
 * [Astarte Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-kubernetes-operator) - The preferred and
   supported way to run Astarte and Astarte Flow - in Production, and pretty much anywhere else
 * Container SDK - Implement and deploy your algorithm as a Docker Container. Available for
   [Python](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_flow_sdk_python)
